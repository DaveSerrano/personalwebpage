        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I had the oportunity and the pleasure to work in different areas in Aviation Industry and to work and learn with many excellent professionals with such a range of expertise in different roles.
        </p>
        <p>In aviation I've worked for different national airlines, based in different cities in Portugal and also international airlines with my previous experience flying Boeing 767.
        As a Pilot, I've been working on ferry flights, sightseeing flights and as a flight Instructor (VFR and IFR).
        Flying B767, I had the oportunity to operate over Europe, America, Asia and Africa not only schedule flights but also charter flights, ACMI and cargo flights.
        
        <p>
        I'm currently working as a Certified Flight Instructor in Cascais - LPCS (Lisbon area) conducting mainly IFR Instruction Flights on SEP airplanes.</p>

        Landings+T.offs +3000</p>
        <p>
        Flying is my passion but as a result of my experience, I've gained curiosity on some other areas in Aviation and because of that I am looking forward to study, learn and develop more competences in areas as Safety, Operations, Communication and Human Resources.</p>
        <p>
        Besides aviation I have some other interests like travel and visit historical places. I've traveled around the globe once (and hopefully not the last).       I like running and I often participate on mini-marathons.
        I like music (I would like to learn playing drums).
        I'm curious about IT in areas such Web Programming and Front-end Development.
        And at last, someday, sooner than later, I'll take my Basic Skipper Licence.</p>
